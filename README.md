CURRENT SUMMARY:
3D meshgrid displaying the location (latitude, longitude) and intensity of earthquakes across the world in the past month, between the dates 8-19-2025 and 9-18-2025.

TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
- map on the bottom to display where in the world the earthquakes occur
- faster animated video

___
3D Earthquake Visualization

Animated 3D visualization of recent earthquakes, showing their magnitudes and geographic distribution on an interpolated 3D surface with an optional map or coastlines as reference.

Overview
This project processes earthquake data from the past month (can be any month or length of time, adjustable in the code) and visualizes it in 3D. Each earthquake is plotted using its latitude, longitude, and magnitude, and the values are interpolated across a grid to create a smooth surface.

The visualization highlights:
- Earthquake magnitude (z-axis)
- Geographic location (latitude and longitude)
- Animated changes over time (optional)
- A world map or coastlines can be added as a reference “floor” to provide geographic context.

Features
- 3D Surface Plot: Interpolated earthquake magnitudes using RBF interpolation and Gaussian smoothing.
- Animation: Optional time-based animation of earthquake activity.
- Contour Footprint: 2D contour map showing earthquake intensity on the floor.
- (WIP) Map Reference: Supports either a raster image or vector coastlines using Cartopy.
- Customizable View: Adjustable elevation, azimuth, and aspect ratio for personalized visualization.
